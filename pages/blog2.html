                <br/> This is going to sound like some stupid teenage story where her friends are literally everything and shit but sure, why not. Beshy squad is what my friends and I call our group. It consists of eight people: (1) Me, (2) Ella, (3) Pauline, (4) Jasper, (5) Alcrysel, (6) Ras, (7) Yolah, and (8) Xza. Recently, I have spent an inoridnate amount of time with these people. Resulting in either very cute pictures or very funny faces. Due to a massive project that I've somehow roped them into, we've spent the past three weeks with cameras and a tripod in tow, and these are just a few of my favorite *unedited* shots.

            My favorite picture is definitely the last one. Kids aren't always my forte but this seemed like such a cute picture. That girl is Jasper's little sister - Jacobe. Now there are 20 pictures above this text, and although it seems like they are very candid pictures, it's been carefully chosen and filtered, among hundreds of other pictures. We aren't exactly the most photogenic in life. These are only the pictures we've taken in the past three weeks. THREE WEEKS. And we only got 20 good ones - this speaks a lot about us. *cue sad laugh* Now, these people have made me laugh more in the past 12 months than I have laughed in the past 2 years. They're the kind of people who eat your food, make jokes about mistakes, and laugh when you trip. But they're also the kind of people who will be with you every step of the way, and inspire you to be greater than you are. In normal circumstances, we would never be friends. They can find me sometimes a little snobbish, annoying, bossy, and many other things. And vice versa. But due to similar hate over the same person, we found ourselves hating together. I am grateful to be able to find these people and the very bad series of unfortunate events that led us together. Hopefully you find people like this as well.
