                <br/> This is a little bit different than the past two ones, with two major reasons. (1) This mostly has my face in it, so I apologize for breaking your screen in advance; (2) these are not taken with a professional camera, but with a smartphone in occasionally not so ideal lighting. This is here due to the emotional turmoil I experienced this year, compared to a happier time last year - the time these pictures were taken. This is going to be a brief recollection of everything, mostly the things I want to remember. (Weird how most of it is my face, but I digress) After a year, I guess things just get twisted up in my brain. I'd like to put this somewhere that doesn't keep changing. And I'll probably come back and add whenever I feel the nostalgia rushing.<br><br>
                To start off, we flew a plane - which was Julliard's (my teammate) first time flying. I arrived pretty late (sorry!) and we literally got the last seats. LITERALLY THE LAST ONES. We had snacks, munchkins and tonkatsu, courtesy of Kent. We were estimated to arrive at around noon, so we were getting kinda hungry.

            When we arrived, we were hungry students wandering, waiting for adults. We mostly waited for my mother as she lost her way around NAIA (even though she's been there a MILLION times). Thus this picture:

            The following pictures are from the bus -  on the way to dinner. With the sun setting perfectly in one of the pictures. If you look close enough, you can also see that Mary Yssabelle Hermosa (me) is the ONLY one with two events at a national level. An achievement that is not appreciated enough locally. lol. But the people I met there were very nice and supportive about it. One even made me reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaal nervous due to the way he talked about it. But this is a story for another time.

            Next up was dinner at Holiday land. It was mostly local food, and frankly not my type of food. But that's alright, I loved their halohalo bar (despite not having any ice cream). Mostly I just got lots of ube jam and milk aand a few other sweet toppings. Most importantly, I just got full. That's more than enough to eb thankful for.

            These next ones ar of my first proper day in Vigan. Ate at a wonderful restaurant, came to STI Vigan, and finally checked in at the hotel. There's also one of me gesturing to my event - Essay Does It. "You can't spell essay without yssa." These were my words before actually failing to place (lol). But all is well.

            These pics are from the official event day. Yssa is reaaally feeling herself with those brows, please don't mind her. The third picture is of me with my friend's hand. (Yo kyle wassup - thanks for the ice cream) Then a picture of us with sir Norman, our beloved school coordinator assigned to keep us in check and feed us. Thanks sir! I doubt things would be the same if it were someone else. Then a full Vigan Team group pic. Legendary.

            Then a picture with the members of the think Quest Team from STi Alabang - who finished a rank higher than us. They proved to be great competition. (We didn't get a proper picture with the champions, sorry STI San Fernando. :(      ) And to Sir Stanley who had high hopes for us since the cluster competition. I hope to see you this year as well.

            I think all in all, it was an amazing opportunity. There's no other school that would have granted me with this type of events other than my current one, so that's amazing. It was definitely a well earned prize, maybe even more than I deserve. I made a lot of friends, who I hope to be able to see again someday, and I made a lot of memories, although some are not fit to be placed in public. I think after winning locals, clusters and nationals, although well fought for, was like icing on top of a cake. Okay, bad metaphor, I don't actually like cake, but you get the gist. I competed with so many people, to get to where I got, and it was not easy. STI definitely made it worth all the trouble. I will go back this year. I'm calling it.
