                    <br><br><br><br><br>What do you want me to say?<br><br>
                    I could say that I’m having a blast, that online school is <b></b>just like regular classes. I could say that I prefer having classes online, but that wouldn’t exactly be truthful. I have spent these past school days on the repercussions of my section being fused to another. Mostly it’s been uncomfortable messages back and forth with teachers regarding my status, and why my name still isn’t coming up on their class lists. Yes, I’ve talked to the people I needed to talk to, and I do understand that they are currently swamped with the amount of work they have to do in such a short time. So here I am, writing about an experience that barely started.
                    <br><br>
                    Frankly, my privilege is what brought me here. I have parents who support my studies.I didn’t need to buy any gadgets and my internet is mostly stable. All of that has led me to having very minor inconveniences so I’m glad to even be enrolled. With the limited time I’ve had, the opportunity to immerse myself in my Moodle course (note: module — singular, only have one enrolled so far) has been great. I’ve been able to just speed through what I needed to do this week. And that’s what I like the most with this framework. I always have either too much time or not enough time, and with this style I can allocate my extra time into the projects or assignments that I think I need more time to finish. It’s a win-win situation. Obviously, it’s very early on and I’m not expecting things to be at this pace forever, but I am enjoying it for now. There is a lot of freedom to work at my own pace and that’s not something regular classes can offer. 
                    <br><br>
                    Another thing about moving online has been all the webinars and meetings. I’d be lying if I said I haven’t fallen asleep during one or two of those many zoom meetings. I get really exhausted. For some reason, staring at a screen for hours drains my energy more than a whole day of different classes. I think my body needs to adjust to what my ‘work day’ is becoming, and I probably need to get my eyes checked just in case. I’m part of different orgs, and these meetings usually happen at night, when it’s sure that no one is in class anymore. And sometimes they’re exhausting, can barely keep track of the conversation, and sometimes they’re fun. It’s given me an opportunity to talk with people, who I would probably not have the opportunity to talk with before quarantine hit. I’m still a firm believer that orgs, meetings, and seminars are a big part of college life. But considering how our country deals with pandemics, all I can do is hope that next year will be twice as much fun to make up for this year’s absences.
                    <br><br>
                    I still miss going to school. The busy hallways, the crowded canteen, and even the quick-walks between consecutive periods. My brain is trained to think about school work at school, and to relax at home. It will take time before I can establish a good rhythm and compartmentalize these work hours, and not letting my ‘home vibes’ distract me from actually working on something. But I’ll get there. So that is my experience with this framework, and with CIT moving online. I’m overly hopeful that next semester will be back to ‘normal,' but maybe online isn’t so bad.
